# saber
These scripts are part of a project to experiment with sound and motion. I wanted to produce a device that would sound a bit like a light saber when swung. 
* analyzer.py takes in a wav file and produces a spectrum anaysis of the frequencies used in the wav
* soundonly.py creates the basic sound without any modifications
* saber.py tempors the base sound based on motion measured by an Adafruit BNO055
* pwmtest.py creates a tone on the buzzer pin 18





## Setup notes:
* Runs on Python 3.7 or later.  
* To get the latest version of Python on Raspberry Pi, I found it easiest to download the newest raspbian OS first.
* These all work great on python 3.9 and 64bit Rasbian
* Install the libraries first before running the scripts
  * Sudo pip3 install for each of these
    * numpy
    * pygame
    * adafruit_bno055
    * busio
* audio output is via the audio jack. Be sure to set it to jack and not hdmi
